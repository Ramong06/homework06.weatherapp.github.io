# homework06.weatherapp.github.io

This homework was assigned to me by the University of Texas at University of Houston Trilogy Coding Bootcamp.  It's purpose is to help me learn how and when to use AJAX, GET, APIs, and LOCAL STORAGE.

Getting Started and Steps
1. When you open the page you should be presented with a search bar where you enter the city name in which you wish to know the weather.
2. Enter the name of the city you wish to search weather info for and click search.
3. You should then see the current weather for said city in a section displaying the current Weather, Humidity, Wind Speed and UV Index.
4. Underneath the current weather section you should see a 5 day forcast displaying the same information as the current weather for the next 5 days.
5. Your city searched should append to a list below the search bar.
6. You can click on the appended city and pull up the weather info without creating a new search. 
7. Searched city info should remain on page.
